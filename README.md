# HueTastic
HueTastic is a small hobby project to operate Hue bridges / devices in your local network. It started mid-2016 due to the lack of apps with a reasonable good UI. The goal of this project is to have a good integration into the operating system and a good usability.

## Techical

### API
To operate the Hue bridges, the official [API][1] is used.

## Progress

### Ideas
One idea would be to handle light colors like in [Huetro][4]. You can upload an image (which also is the scene image) and place color pickers onto the image. These color pickers also represent the single lights and their color.

### First version
You can find the planed features for the first version of the app in the [project plan][3].
